## Cursor Development Rules

### Keeping Files Updated
- When editing any file, always update **`requirements.txt`** to include only the necessary packages
- Do not hardcode sensitive information (e.g., API keys, credentials); load them from **Git-ignored config files**
- For each config file that includes secrets, create and maintain an **up-to-date sample file** (e.g., `.env.sample`)

### `.gitignore` Rules
- Add any file that includes sensitive information (e.g., `.env`, `secret_config.json`) to `.gitignore`
- Also add system-specific hidden files such as `.DS_Store` (macOS) to `.gitignore`

### Implementation Rules
- If a feature or behavior is described in this project, **implement it yourself automatically without asking for confirmation**
